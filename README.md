# Health-Insurance-Eye-care-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the financial burden of eye care services in Nigeria, focusing on the gap between clinic prices and insurance coverage. It aims to provide insights for the average Nigerian on the out-of-pocket costs for essential eye services like refraction, cataract surgery, and prescription glasses.

### Data Sources

### Key Insights
- Patients pay **â‚¦28,550** on average out-of-pocket for eye care.
- Insurance covers only **23.4%** of service costs.
- **Cataract surgery** has the highest financial gap with **83%** of costs falling on patients.
- **60%** of patients pay fully for glasses despite having insurance.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions
